Admission Criteria for Transfer Applicants

GENERAL INFORMATION
Visit SF State Future Students to learn about the application process and minimum eligibility requirements for admission as a
transfer student. For non-impacted majors, completion of lower division major requirements is not mandatory for admission to
SF State or for acceptance to most majors. However, we recommend that students complete as many lower division
requirements as possible before transfer, including for the major, General Education (GE) and American Institutions (AI). Use the
Transferable Courses search tool in ASSIST to verify approved articulation for CSU GE and CSU AI.

Additional criteria may be required for admission to impacted majors. More information here.

External Examination Credit

With qualifying scores, external exam credit can apply to certain GE, AI and major requirements. More information here about
credit for external exams such as Advanced Placement.

Understanding this agreement

SF State lower division courses for this major are displayed in the Requirement Information section below (left side).
Articulated courses displayed on the right side will satisfy the corresponding major requirement.

“No course articulated” means that a course from this transfer institution has not been identified or approved to be taken in
place of the SF State course.

Not displayed in this agreement: upper division major requirements, or additional requirements for graduation such as
General Education and other non-major requirements. Visit the Undergraduate Education section of the University Bulletin
for information about non-major requirements for the Bachelor’s degree.

Changes to this agreement

Major requirements are subject to change from one academic year to the next. Newly-articulated courses are added on a rolling
basis, and articulation status for some courses can be revised or ended. Visit ASSIST every semester for the most current
information, and consult with an academic counselor at your institution on a regular basis.

ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER
ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER

ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER
The AS-T in Computer Science (SB 1440 degree) is an approved transfer pathway for this major. Visit SF State ADT
Pathways and Roadmaps for a list of all approved ADT pathways for SF State degree programs and to view sample post-
transfer advising roadmaps for each pathway.

Students preparing to transfer into this major at SF State should complete any available articulated courses in the Requirement
section(s) below.  Completion of the American Institutions requirement (US-1, US-2, US-3) before transfer is also strongly
recommended.

JAVA ADVISORY
JAVA ADVISORY

JAVA ADVISORY
A foundation in the Java programming language is required for upper division coursework in this major, and CSC 210 and CSC
220 provide this foundation. Prospective students are strongly encouraged to complete lower division courses that include
instruction in Java.

UPPER DIVISION ARTICULATION
UPPER DIVISION ARTICULATION

This agreement involves articulation of lower division coursework completed at a transfer institution with upper division major
requirements at SF State. If taken before transfer, the content requirement in the major has been satisfied. However, units
earned for lower division courses taken before transfer cannot apply to minimum upper division unit requirements in the major or
for the degree.
